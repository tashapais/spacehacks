# Web Frontend (Planned)

Planned stack: React + Vite + TypeScript, D3/Visx for graph visualization, Zustand for global state, Tailwind or NASA-inspired custom styling.

The frontend will consume the FastAPI/GraphQL services defined in `docs/dashboard_concept.md`. Implementation pending data pipeline maturation.
